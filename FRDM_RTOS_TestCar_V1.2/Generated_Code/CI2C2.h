**     Abstract    :
**          This component encapsulates the internal I2C communication
**          interface. The implementation of the interface is based
**          on the Philips I2C-bus specification version 2.0.
**          Interface features:
**          MASTER mode
**            - Multi master communication
**            - The combined format of communication possible
**              (see SendStop parameter in MasterSend/ReceiveBlock method)
**            - 7-bit slave addressing (10-bit addressing can be made as well)
**            - Acknowledge polling provided
**            - No wait state initiated when a slave device holds the SCL line low
**            - Holding of the SCL line low by slave device recognized as 'not available bus'
**            - Invalid start/stop condition detection provided
**          SLAVE mode
**            - 7-bit slave addressing
**            - General call address detection provided

**     @param
**         DeviceDataPtr   - Device data structure
**                           pointer returned by <Init> method.
**     @param
**         AddrType        - Specify type of slave address
**                           (7bit, 10bit or general call address), e.g.
**                           LDD_I2C_ADDRTYPE_7BITS.
**     @param
**         Addr            - 7bit or 10bit slave address value.
**     @return
**                         - Error code, possible codes:

**                           the active clock configuration
**                           ERR_PARAM_ADDRESS_TYPE -  Invalid address
